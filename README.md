# The Laugher

Comprised of a app engine host and an app, The Laugher, allows users to create and share jokes. This was a fun project to make not because of the sheer amount of funny jokes I saw, but process of writing a bot to not only find jokes on the web but classify them as well.

### Features

- [x] Joke Scraping 
- [x] Simple Android App

### A Note

This app was not serious but rather me playing around in some new libraries and testing out capabilities. In fact the server side has been lost since making the app but involved a lot of new web scraping techniques.
